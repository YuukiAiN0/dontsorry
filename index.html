                        <strong>- Lack of Specificity :</strong>
                        <br>
                        When an apology is repeated without any details about what the person is truly sorry for, it can come across as a reflex rather than a sincere statement.
                        <br>This can give the impression that the individual is unaware of, or unconcerned about, the consequences of their actions.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>- Over-Apologizing Reduces Impact :</strong>
                        <br>
                        Saying "sorry" too often might diminish the meaning of the apology. Expressing real regret can come across as dismissive or an attempt to pacify the listener <br>without completely acknowledging their feelings. In professional settings, this can impair trust by indicating a lack of confidence or self-assurance.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>- Focus on Words Rather Than Actions :</strong> 
                        <br>
                        An successful apology frequently focuses on resolving the situation or making amends rather than simply expressing remorse. Simply saying "I'm sorry" without taking action can feel empty or avoidant. Genuine apologies involve acknowledging the mistake and committing to reform.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>- Potential for Appearing Overly Defensive :</strong> 
                        <br>
                        Saying "sorry" repeatedly may give the impression that the speaker is seeking forgiveness or reassurance too quickly, potentially shifting the focus away from the other person’s feelings. Instead of validating the person’s emotions, it can make the listener feel pressured to accept the apology before fully processing the situation.
